Eater Of Worlds for Ludum Dare 38.

You are a hungry cosmic worm that eats worlds, eat the small worlds! 
Destroy a planet by smashing into it with your head, you need sufficient speed to destroy a planet.
Don't stand still as you grow more hungry and your health deteriorates.

WASD or arrow keys to move (D or backarrow aren't used.)
